## About Me

If you are seeing this, then you should be here for 2 reasons: you are looking at the source code of my site, or you have scrolled down on the main website. I thought I would put some more things about me in case you're interested.

## About Me

 - I'm a Conservative Christian
 - I run a small computer refurbishing buissness. I fix and/or upgrade old computers and sell them locally.
 - I hate all Apple products. I use Android and Windows/Ubuntu.
 - I used X10Hosting before Github.
 - Before I got interested in tech, I was obsessed with legos. I built big cities and cool RVs.
 - I have been making Youtube videos for 3+ years [https://www.youtube.com/c/PetabyteStudios](https://www.youtube.com/c/PetabyteStudios)
 - My favorite game is BeamNG.Drive

## Other stuff

Pretty much everything I have ever made is on Github, so I don't get paid. I am also saving up to get a car (Jeep probably) so if you want to donate here: http://v.ht/2NpC
